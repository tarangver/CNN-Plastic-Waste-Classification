## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is the **Waste Classification Data** by Sashaank Sekar. It contains a total of 25,077 labeled images, divided into two categories: **Organic** and **Recyclable**. This dataset is designed to facilitate waste classification tasks using machine learning techniques.  


### Key Details:
- **Total Images**: 25,077  
  - **Training Data**: 22,564 images (85%)  
  - **Test Data**: 2,513 images (15%)  
- **Classes**: Organic and Recyclable  
- **Purpose**: To aid in automating waste management and reducing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.
  
### Approach:  
- Studied waste management strategies and white papers.

### **üìå Conclusion & Summary of Model Performance**  
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview of the Model**  
The trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model was designed to classify waste into two categories:  
- **O (Organic Waste)**  
- **R (Recyclable Waste)**  

It was trained on a dataset of **training images** using convolutional layers, max-pooling, batch normalization, and fully connected dense layers. The model was optimized using **categorical cross-entropy loss** and evaluated based on **accuracy**.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation on Test Data**  
After training, the model was evaluated on a separate test dataset. The results are as follows:  

‚úÖ **Test Accuracy**: **85.32%**  
‚úÖ **Test Loss**: **0.3997**  

üîπ This means the model correctly classifies waste in **85 out of 100 cases** on unseen data. The **low test loss** indicates that the model has learned meaningful patterns and is **not overfitting** significantly.

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Predictions and Sample Results**  
The model made predictions on test images, converting probability outputs into class labels. Here‚Äôs a sample of predicted vs. actual results:

- **Predicted Classes**: `['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'R', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']`
- **Actual Classes**: `['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O']`

üîπ The model mostly predicted correctly, but **one case (index 5) was classified as "R" instead of "O"**, indicating a potential misclassification.

---

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Classification Report Analysis**  
The **classification report** provides deeper insights into model performance for each class:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **O (Organic)** | 0.89 | 0.84 | 0.86 | 1401 |
| **R (Recyclable)** | 0.81 | 0.87 | 0.84 | 1112 |
| **Overall Accuracy** | **85%** |  
| **Macro Avg (Balanced Score for Classes)** | **85%** |
| **Weighted Avg (Adjusted for Imbalance)** | **85%** |

üìå **Key Observations:**  
üîπ **Precision for Organic (O) is higher**: The model is more confident when predicting **Organic waste** than **Recyclable waste**.  
üîπ **Recall for Recyclable (R) is higher**: The model captures more actual **Recyclable waste** but sometimes **mislabels Organic waste as Recyclable**.  
üîπ **Balanced F1-score**: The model performs **well for both classes**, with a small **bias towards predicting Organic waste correctly**.

---

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Confusion Matrix Insights**  
The **confusion matrix** helps visualize the model‚Äôs errors:  

- **1401 Organic waste samples**:  
  - **1180 were correctly classified as Organic (True Positives)**  
  - **221 were misclassified as Recyclable (False Negatives)**  

- **1112 Recyclable waste samples**:  
  - **968 were correctly classified as Recyclable (True Positives)**  
  - **144 were misclassified as Organic (False Positives)**  

üìå **Key Takeaways from Confusion Matrix:**  
‚úÖ The model performs well overall but **struggles slightly more with distinguishing Recyclable waste** from Organic waste.  
‚úÖ **221 Organic samples were wrongly classified as Recyclable waste**, which might be due to overlapping features (e.g., **food-contaminated paper/cardboard**).  

---

### **üöÄ Final Conclusion:**
- The **CNN model** has achieved **85.32% accuracy**, which is a strong performance for waste classification.  
- The **model performs slightly better for Organic waste** but can sometimes **misclassify Recyclable waste**.  
- **Possible Improvements:**
  - Adding **more diverse training data** to reduce misclassification.
  - Applying **data augmentation** to expose the model to **more variations**.
  - Experimenting with **fine-tuning on pre-trained CNN models** (like ResNet, VGG16) to further boost accuracy.  
  - Tweaking **hyperparameters** (learning rate, dropout rate) to optimize performance.  

‚úÖ **Overall, the model is highly effective and can be used for real-world waste classification tasks with further refinements!** üî•‚ôªÔ∏è
